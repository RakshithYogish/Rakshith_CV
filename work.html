        <h3 class="rebirth_heading">Career Transition: From Test Engineer to Developer</h3>
        <p class="rebirth_desc">After a successful year as a test engineer, I took a step back to pursue a personal goal 
            and challenge myself by preparing for civil service exams. 
            Although my efforts didn't result in the outcome I had hoped for. 
            With heavy heart, keeping failure in one hand and desire to grow back in another, i chose latter.
            I doubled down on my passion for technology and used some time to 
            continuously evolve my skills to be a software developer. My background in testing has given me a unique 
            perspective on the software development process, allowing me to approach projects with a comprehensive 
            understanding of the entire lifecycle. I am now eager to bring my refreshed skills and unwavering passion 
            back to the workforce and make a meaningful contribution as a software developer. I am confident that my 
            drive, determination, and commitment to continuous learning will make me a valuable asset to any organization.</p>
